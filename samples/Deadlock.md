# 🔥Save 🐧Pingouins

## 🎯 The Goal

You evolves on a circular *🧊ice floe* with seven other *🐧pingouins*.
And you have to bring a *🐟fish*  in the *🕳️hole* and save the *🧊ice floe*.

## ✔️ Rules

The movements of the *🐧pingouins* melt the *🧊ice floe*.
Thefore the size of *🧊ice floe* decrease according to the *⚡energy consumption*.

### 🏆 Victory Conditions

* Bring a *🐟fish*
* Stay on the *🧊ice floe*

### ☠️ Defeat Conditions

* Not bring a *🐟fish* in due time: `50 turns`.
* Fall in the water.
* No send an ACTION in due time: `10 ms`.
* Send non-well formed output.

### 🏅 Ranking

The *🐧pingouins*:
* with a *🐟fish* are sorted by time elapsed to get a fish: first score `8 points`, second `7 points`, third  `6 points`...
* without a fish score `0 points`
* falled in the water are sorted by time elapsed on the *🧊ice floe*: first `-8 points`, second `-7 points` 
* disqualified: score `-10 points`

Finnaly the score is multiply by number of *🐧pingouins* on the *🧊ice floe*. So the best score is `64 points` and worse `80 points`.

## 🐯 Expert Rules

### *⚡energy consumption*

The referee additionate the *⚡energy consumption* - Sum of player's velocity squared. And compute the new radius:

```speudocode
SURFACE_MAX = 10000;
SURFACE_FACTOR = 0.1;
PI = 3.14;

iceFloe.energyConsumed += players.ForEach( player -> player.Velocity * player.Velocity).Sum();
iceFloe.radius = sqrt( (SURFACE_MAX - iceFloe.energyConsumed * SURFACE_FACTOR)/ PI);
```

### ⛸️ Motion Engine

player send a cartesian vector X,Y

```speudocode
VELOCITY_MAX_SQUARED = 50*50;

... TODO
```

### Colision engine

```speudocode
```

## ⚠️ Note

## 💡 Hint

The game is a trade off of your individual goal and collective goal.
