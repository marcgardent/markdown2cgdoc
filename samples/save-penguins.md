# 🔥 Save 🐧 Penguins

## 🎯 The Goal

You evolve on a circular *🧊ice floe* with seven other *🐧penguins*.
And you have to get a *🐟fish*  in the *🕳️hole* and save the *🧊ice floe*.

## ✔️ Rules

The ⚡energy consumed by the *🐧penguins* melt the *🧊ice floe*.
Therefore the size of *🧊ice floe* decrease accordingly.


### 🏆 Victory Conditions

* Keep alive until the last turn:
  * Get a *🐟fish*
  * Stay on the *🧊ice floe*

### ☠️ Defeat Conditions

* out of energy: Not get a *🐟fish* in due time: `50` turns.
* Fall in the water.
* No send an `ACTION` in due time: `10` ms.
* Send non-well formed output.

### 🏅 Ranking

The *🐧penguins*:
* with a *🐟fish* are ordered by the time elapsed to get a fish: first score `8` points, second `7` points, third  `6` points...
* without a fish score `0 points`
* fell in the water are ordered by time elapsed on the *🧊ice floe*: first `-1` points, second `-2` points, etc...
* disqualified: score `-10` points

Finally, the score is multiplied by the number of *🐧penguins* on the *🧊ice floe*. So the best score is `64` points and worse `80` points.

## 🐯 Expert Rules

### *⚡energy consumption*

The referee sum the *⚡energy consumption*  of the turn. And he computes the new radius:

```speudocode
iceFloe.energyConsumed += players.ForEach( player -> 1000 + player.Velocity * player.Velocity).Sum();
iceFloe.radius = sqrt( (SURFACE_MAX - iceFloe.energyConsumed * SURFACE_FACTOR)/ PI);

SURFACE_MAX = 10000;
SURFACE_FACTOR = 0.1;
PI = 3.14;
```
### ⛸️ Motion Engine

player send a cartesian vector X,Y

```speudocode
VELOCITY_MAX_SQUARED = 50*50;

... TODO
```

### Colision engine

```speudocode
```

## ⚠️ Note

## 💡 Hint

The game is a trade off of your individual goal and collective goal.
